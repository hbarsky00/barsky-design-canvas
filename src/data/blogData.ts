      <p>As a solo product designer, it's easy to get caught in the loop of building, tweaking, and endlessly polishing. You finish something—maybe on a platform like lovable.dev—but then… crickets.</p>
      
      <p>No real users. No real data. No clue how to market.</p>
      
      <p>That was me. And if you're reading this, it might be you too.</p>
      
      <p>Here's the good news: even without marketing experience or live data, you can share your work in a way that gets attention, starts conversations, and builds momentum.</p>
      
      <p>This post is for solo designers who want to take that next step—without pretending to be a marketing guru.</p>
      
      <h2>1. Own the "Solo Designer" Story</h2>
      
      <p>People connect with people. You're not a faceless brand—you're a designer who built something from scratch. That's a story in itself.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Write 2-3 sentences about why you built it.</li>
        <li>Be honest about the current state (e.g., "It's functional but uses placeholder data").</li>
        <li>Frame it as a work-in-progress, not a final product.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Example intro you could use on Twitter or LinkedIn:</strong><br>
      "Built this solo in nights and weekends—wanted to solve a real problem I kept seeing. It's not live yet (mock data only), but I'd love your feedback."</p>
      
      <h2>2. Create a "Tour" Instead of a Launch</h2>
      
      <p>If there's no real data or users, make your marketing about the experience—not the stats.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Record a quick walkthrough (Loom, ScreenStudio, or Figma prototype video).</li>
        <li>Narrate your thinking: why each screen exists, how you simplified flows, what tradeoffs you made.</li>
        <li>Post the tour on your site or share the video on social.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Designers LOVE seeing other designers' behind-the-scenes thinking. That's the real value.</p>
      
      <h2>3. Package Your Work as a Case Study</h2>
      
      <p>Think of it as a product design portfolio piece—not a product you're "selling."</p>
      
      <p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Problem you tried to solve</li>
        <li>User type and use case (even if fictional)</li>
        <li>Screens or flows with commentary</li>
        <li>Key design decisions</li>
        <li>What you'd do next if it were a real product</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Post it on:</strong></p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Your personal site or blog</li>
        <li>Medium / UX Collective</li>
        <li>Notion (people love public Notion docs)</li>
        <li>LinkedIn articles</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>4. Find the "Designer Corners" of the Internet</h2>
      
      <p>There's no need to blast ads or beg for signups. Instead, share your work where product designers hang out:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Reddit: r/userexperience, r/web_design, r/design_critiques</li>
        <li>Twitter/X: Share a thread that breaks down the build</li>
        <li>LinkedIn: Post your walkthrough + invite design feedback</li>
        <li>Figma Community: Publish reusable components or templates if relevant</li>
        <li>UX Discords / Slack groups: Ask if anyone's solving a similar problem</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>5. Ask for Feedback, Not Fame</h2>
      
      <p>Instead of aiming for 100 likes, aim for 5 conversations with other designers.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What to ask:</strong></p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>"Would you approach this problem differently?"</li>
        <li>"Is there a smoother way to solve this use case?"</li>
        <li>"Do you think this has potential in the real world?"</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>This is still design work. Sharing and improving is part of the job—not just shipping.</p>
      
      <h2>6. Turn It Into a Series</h2>
      
      <p>Instead of one big post, break your experience into smaller bits of content over a few weeks:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>"Why I built this"</li>
        <li>"Sketching out the core flow"</li>
        <li>"Simplifying the onboarding experience"</li>
        <li>"What I learned launching a fake product"</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>You'll stay top of mind, build credibility, and show growth over time.</p>
      
      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      
      <p>You don't need real users to be a real designer.<br>
      You don't need metrics to talk about your process.<br>
      And you don't need a marketing degree to start showing up.</p>
      
      <p>If you've built something—especially alone—you already did the hard part.</p>
      
      <p>Now, just let people in on the journey.</p>
      
      <p><strong>P.S.</strong> If you've got a project you want feedback on, feel free to DM me or drop a link in the comments. Happy to nerd out with you.</p>
