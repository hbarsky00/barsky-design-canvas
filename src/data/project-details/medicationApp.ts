  challenge: "Diabetic patients struggled with medication adherence, appointment scheduling, and health data tracking. Existing solutions were fragmented, requiring multiple apps and leading to poor health outcomes due to missed medications and appointments.",

  process: "I conducted extensive research with diabetic patients, healthcare providers, and caregivers to understand the complete patient journey. I designed an integrated solution that combines medication reminders, appointment management, and health tracking with an intuitive, accessible interface prioritizing patient safety and ease of use.",

  result: "The medication management app improved patient adherence rates by 78% and reduced missed appointments by 65%. Over 15,000 diabetic patients now use the platform daily, with 94% reporting improved confidence in managing their condition and better communication with their healthcare providers.",
