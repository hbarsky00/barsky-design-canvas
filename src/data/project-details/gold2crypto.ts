  challenge: "Traditional investors interested in cryptocurrency face a significant barrier to entry due to the complexity of trading platforms and the disconnect between conventional gold investments and digital currency markets. There was a need for a platform that could bridge these two worlds while providing a user-friendly interface that appeals to both experienced investors and newcomers to cryptocurrency. The existing solutions were either too technical for traditional investors or lacked the sophisticated features required for serious trading activities.",
  process: "I led the design and development of a sophisticated cryptocurrency trading platform that specifically addresses the needs of traditional gold investors entering the crypto market. Through extensive market research and user interviews with both traditional investors and crypto enthusiasts, I identified key friction points and opportunities to simplify the trading experience. I developed comprehensive wireframes and interactive prototypes that were refined through multiple rounds of user testing with different investor demographics to ensure the platform met diverse user needs.",
