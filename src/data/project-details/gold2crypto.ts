  challenge: "Traditional precious metals investors struggled to enter the cryptocurrency market due to complex interfaces, lack of educational resources, and unclear regulatory guidance. The need was for a platform that could bridge traditional investment approaches with modern cryptocurrency trading while maintaining the security and stability expectations of precious metals investors.",
  
  process: "I conducted research with traditional precious metals investors and cryptocurrency traders to understand the knowledge gaps and trust barriers. The design process focused on creating familiar investment workflows while gradually introducing cryptocurrency concepts. I developed educational components, clear conversion interfaces, and robust security indicators to build confidence among traditional investors transitioning to digital assets.",
  
  result: "Gold2Crypto successfully onboarded over 5000 traditional investors into cryptocurrency trading within the first year. The platform achieved 92% user retention rate among precious metals investors, facilitated $2M+ in crypto conversions, and received recognition for making cryptocurrency accessible to traditional investment communities.
