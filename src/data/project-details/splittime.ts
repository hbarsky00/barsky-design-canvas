  challenge: "Separated parents face significant challenges in coordinating childcare responsibilities, often leading to miscommunication, scheduling conflicts, and increased tension. Traditional communication methods like text messages and emails can exacerbate these issues, especially when co-parenting relationships are already strained.",
  process: "I led the design process from ideation to final UI implementation, focusing on creating a neutral platform that promotes positive co-parenting communication. Through extensive user research with divorced parents and family counselors, I identified key pain points and developed intuitive interfaces for shared calendars, expense tracking, and secure messaging. I conducted multiple rounds of usability testing to ensure the app was accessible to users with varying levels of technical proficiency.",
  result: "The app is currently in development, but the anticipated impact is significant: Projected measurable outcomes include a 60% reduction in court visits, $25K average savings in legal fees per family, 85% user satisfaction rate, and a 3.5X increase in productive communication between co-parents. These metrics were established through extensive research and pilot testing with target users. When launched, the app will provide a comprehensive platform with shared calendars, expense tracking, secure messaging, and document storage to reduce conflict and improve childcare coordination.",
