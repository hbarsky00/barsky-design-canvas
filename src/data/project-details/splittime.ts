  challenge: "Time tracking and project management tools were either too complex for small teams or too simplistic for detailed project analysis. Freelancers and small agencies needed a solution that balanced ease of use with powerful analytics, while providing clear insights into project profitability and time allocation across different clients and tasks.",
  
  process: "I conducted extensive user interviews with freelancers, small agency owners, and project managers to understand their time tracking pain points. The design process focused on creating an intuitive interface that made time entry effortless while providing powerful reporting capabilities. I developed a clean, modern design system that emphasized clarity and reduced cognitive load during daily time tracking activities.",
  
  result: "SplitTime became a comprehensive time tracking solution that significantly improved project visibility and profitability analysis for small teams. Users reported 40% more accurate time tracking, improved project budgeting accuracy, and better client communication around project scope and billing. The intuitive interface reduced time tracking friction by 65%.",
