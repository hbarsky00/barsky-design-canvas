  challenge: "The previous data asset search system was confusing for medical professionals, particularly when selecting multiple tags for advanced filtering. Users struggled to efficiently browse the data catalog to find relevant assets, leading to poor user experience and reduced productivity in their asset selection journey.",
  process: "I conducted comprehensive user journey mapping and research specifically focused on medical professionals who needed customizable filters for entities and keywords. Through user interviews, sketching sessions, and comparative analysis using Dribbble research, I developed a clear process flow for the advanced search feature. I established a design system using the client's brand colors (dark blue, green, and gray) to ensure consistency across all design elements. Multiple design iterations were explored, including grid layouts and internal search functionality, before selecting the final version that allowed users to access the Data Asset View and customize it with specific filters.",
  result: "The redesigned advanced search feature successfully optimized access and management of complex asset data while maintaining a user-friendly interface. Users can now search for direct items on the welcome page and apply multiple filters efficiently within the Data Asset Details. The solution saved the client 20% ROI by reducing time spent searching, minimizing errors, boosting productivity, increasing user satisfaction scores, lowering labor costs, and ultimately increasing revenue through improved data asset discovery and utilization.",
