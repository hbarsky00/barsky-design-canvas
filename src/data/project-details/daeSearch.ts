  challenge: "Digital artists and creative professionals struggled with fragmented search experiences across multiple platforms when looking for inspiration, references, and creative resources. Existing search tools lacked the visual sophistication and contextual understanding needed for creative work, leading to inefficient workflows and missed creative opportunities.",
  
  process: "The design process involved deep research into creative workflows, interviewing digital artists, designers, and content creators to understand their search behaviors and pain points. I developed an AI-powered search interface that could understand visual context, artistic styles, and creative intent. The design emphasized visual hierarchy, intuitive filtering, and seamless integration with creative tools.",
  
  result: "The DAE Search platform revolutionized how creative professionals discover and organize visual content. The AI-powered search delivered highly relevant results with contextual understanding of artistic styles and themes. Users reported 60% faster content discovery, improved creative workflow efficiency, and enhanced inspiration gathering capabilities.",
