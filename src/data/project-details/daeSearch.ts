  challenge: "Medical professionals using the previous data asset search system faced significant usability challenges, particularly when applying multiple filtering tags for advanced searches. The interface was confusing and inefficient, making it difficult for users to quickly locate relevant medical data assets. This poor user experience directly impacted productivity and workflow efficiency, as healthcare professionals spent excessive time navigating complex search parameters instead of focusing on patient care and medical research.",
  process: "I conducted comprehensive user journey mapping and in-depth research with medical professionals to understand their specific needs for customizable entity and keyword filters. Through structured user interviews, collaborative sketching sessions, and competitive analysis using Dribbble research, I developed a streamlined process flow for the advanced search functionality. I established a cohesive design system using the client's brand colors of dark blue, green, and gray to ensure visual consistency. Multiple design iterations were explored, including various grid layouts and internal search approaches, before finalizing the optimal solution that allows seamless access to the Data Asset View with customizable filtering options.",
  result: "The redesigned advanced search feature successfully optimized access and management of complex medical asset data while maintaining exceptional user-friendliness. Healthcare professionals can now efficiently search for specific items directly from the welcome page and apply sophisticated multi-filter combinations within the Data Asset Details section. The solution delivered measurable business impact, saving the client 20% ROI through reduced search time, minimized errors, enhanced productivity, improved user satisfaction scores, lower operational costs, and ultimately increased revenue through superior data asset discovery and utilization.",
