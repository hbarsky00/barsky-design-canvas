  challenge: "Local restaurants and food service businesses needed a modern digital presence that could compete with large chain establishments while maintaining their unique character and community connection. Existing solutions were either too generic or too expensive for small local businesses, creating a gap in effective digital marketing and customer engagement tools.",
  
  process: "I worked directly with local restaurant owners and food service operators to understand their specific challenges around digital marketing, online ordering, and customer retention. The design process emphasized authentic brand representation, easy content management for non-technical users, and integration with existing point-of-sale systems. I created flexible design templates that could adapt to different restaurant styles while maintaining professional quality.",
  
  result: "The BarksyJoint platform helped over 50 local restaurants establish strong digital presences, with participating businesses seeing an average 35% increase in online orders and 25% improvement in customer retention rates. The platform's emphasis on local character and community connection resonated strongly with customers, leading to improved review scores and increased local engagement.",
