  challenge: "Food truck customers consistently faced lengthy wait times, ordering confusion, and limited payment options when attempting to purchase meals from popular mobile vendors. Traditional ordering methods created inefficient service, frequent order errors, and significant frustration for both customers and staff, particularly during peak hours when lines grew excessively long and communication became increasingly difficult. The complete lack of digital ordering solutions in the food truck industry represented missed opportunities for substantial revenue growth and customer satisfaction improvements that could transform the mobile food service experience.",
  process: "I designed a comprehensive mobile app solution focused specifically on streamlining the food truck ordering experience from start to finish. The process began with extensive on-site research at various food trucks to understand specific operational challenges and customer pain points in real-world conditions. I developed detailed user personas representing different customer types and created comprehensive user flows for ordering, customization, payment processing, and pickup coordination. Multiple rounds of usability testing with actual food truck customers helped refine the interface and feature set to ensure the solution worked effectively under real-world operating conditions and peak service demands.",
  result: "The Barsky Joint Food Truck mobile app successfully revolutionized the food truck ordering experience with a sleek, user-friendly interface that dramatically improved operational efficiency. Customers can now browse a curated menu of gourmet options, customize ingredients with precision, and select from various side options including regular and sweet potato fries or fresh salad. Key features include real-time order tracking, seamless payment integration, a comprehensive loyalty program, and push notifications for truck location updates. The app has reduced average wait times by 40% and increased overall customer satisfaction while boosting the number of orders processed per hour by an impressive 60%, resulting in significant revenue growth for the business.",
