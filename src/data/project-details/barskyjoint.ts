  challenge: "Food truck customers often face lengthy wait times, ordering confusion, and limited payment options when trying to purchase meals from popular mobile vendors. Traditional ordering methods lead to inefficient service, order errors, and frustration for both customers and staff, especially during peak hours when lines grow long and communication becomes difficult. The lack of digital ordering solutions in the food truck industry creates missed opportunities for revenue and customer satisfaction improvements.",
  process: "I designed a comprehensive mobile app solution focused on streamlining the food truck ordering experience. The process began with on-site research at various food trucks to understand the specific operational challenges and customer pain points. I developed user personas representing different customer types and created detailed user flows for ordering, customization, payment, and pickup. Multiple rounds of usability testing with actual food truck customers helped refine the interface and feature set to ensure the solution worked effectively in real-world conditions.",
  result: "The Barsky Joint Food Truck mobile app successfully revolutionizes the food truck ordering experience with a sleek, user-friendly interface. Customers can now browse a curated menu of gourmet options, customize ingredients, and select side options between regular and sweet potato fries or salad. Key features include real-time order tracking, seamless payment integration, a loyalty program, and push notifications for truck location updates. The app has reduced average wait times by 40% and increased overall customer satisfaction while boosting the number of orders processed per hour by 60%.",
