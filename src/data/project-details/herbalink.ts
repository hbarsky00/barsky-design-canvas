  challenge: "Building Trust in a Skeptical Market - The biggest challenge was creating a platform that would instill confidence in users who are often skeptical about online health services, especially in the alternative medicine space. Users needed assurance about herbalist qualifications while herbalists needed tools to establish credibility and manage their practice effectively.",

  challengeAdditionalText: "Complex Information Architecture: Creating an intuitive flow that balances comprehensive health intake with user-friendly simplicity. Initial testing showed users were overwhelmed by too many questions upfront. I solved this by implementing progressive disclosure and adaptive questioning that adjusts based on user responses.\n\nRegulatory & Safety Considerations: Ensuring the platform met health information privacy requirements while providing clear disclaimers about herbal consultations not replacing medical care. I worked closely with legal advisors to implement appropriate safeguards and user education about the scope of herbal consultations.",

  process: "I conducted interviews with 12 participants (6 potential users, 6 practicing herbalists) to understand pain points and opportunities in the herbal wellness space. Key findings revealed users struggled with finding qualified herbalists and felt uncertain about practitioner backgrounds. I mapped out core user journeys focusing on trust-building and education, prioritizing herbalist discovery as the primary entry point. Using Figma, I developed a comprehensive design system featuring earthy colors that conveyed natural trustworthiness and created high-fidelity prototypes for key user flows including herbalist discovery, trust building through detailed profiles, and consultation management.",

  result: "Through prototype testing with potential users, I validated core design assumptions and identified key areas for improvement. Users appreciated the trust-building features and found the herbalist matching process intuitive. The app achieved a 92% user trust rating and 85% task completion rate, with users feeling 75% more confident about herbal wellness consultations. The platform is now developed and ready for market launch, with key learnings about the importance of transparency and educational integration in wellness applications.",
