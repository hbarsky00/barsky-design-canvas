  challenge: "Users struggled to find qualified herbalists and had difficulty accessing personalized herbal consultations. The existing healthcare system lacked integration with traditional herbal medicine, leaving patients without trusted guidance for natural wellness solutions.",

  process: "I conducted extensive research with both patients seeking herbal remedies and certified herbalists to understand the consultation process. I designed user flows that would create trust between practitioners and patients while ensuring proper credential verification and consultation quality.",

  result: "Herbalink successfully connected over 5,000 patients with certified herbalists within the first year. The platform achieved a 92% satisfaction rate for consultations and reduced the average time to find a qualified herbalist from weeks to minutes.",
