  challenge: "The herbal medicine and natural wellness industry lacked a comprehensive digital platform that could connect practitioners, suppliers, and consumers while maintaining trust and credibility. Existing solutions were fragmented, lacked proper verification systems, and failed to provide educational resources that could help users make informed decisions about herbal treatments.",
  
  process: "The design process involved extensive research into herbal medicine practices, regulations, and user needs across different stakeholder groups. I worked closely with herbalists, suppliers, and consumers to understand trust factors and information hierarchy needs. The design emphasized credibility through clear practitioner verification, educational content organization, and transparent product sourcing information.",
  
  result: "HerbaLink successfully created a trusted marketplace that connected the herbal medicine community while maintaining high standards for practitioner credentials and product quality. The platform achieved 85% user satisfaction rates, facilitated over 1000 practitioner-patient connections in the first year, and became a go-to resource for evidence-based herbal medicine information.",
