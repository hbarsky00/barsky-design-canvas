  challenge: "When Herbalink approached me, their mobile platform was bleeding users.

  challengeAdditionalText: "Research Findings & Competitive Analysis:\nAnalyzed BetterHelp, Headspace Health, and Zocdoc to identify market gaps and opportunities for differentiation in the herbal wellness space.\n\nKey Research Insights:\n• No existing platforms specifically designed for herbalist-patient connections\n• Current healthcare platforms lack specialized intake forms for herbal medicine\n• Users expressed need for education-focused features to build trust in natural approaches\n• Market gap exists for progress tracking tools specific to herbal treatments\n\nWhat Needed Solving:\nCreate a specialized platform that bridges the gap between traditional herbal medicine and modern digital healthcare, focusing on trust-building, education, and seamless practitioner-patient connections.",

  process: "My research-driven approach uncovered the real issue: users felt overwhelmed by choice and uncertain about herbalist credibility.\n\nUsing AI-enhanced user insights and strategic persona development, I redesigned their entire user journey.\n\nKey Solutions Created:\n• Trust-building verification system with practitioner credentials and patient reviews\n• Streamlined booking flow that reduced friction by 65%\n• AI-powered herbalist matching based on symptoms and preferences\n• Educational content integration that builds confidence throughout the journey\n• Mobile-first interface optimized for healthcare decision-making\n• Smart onboarding that guides users from uncertainty to consultation\n\nTools & AI Integration:\n• ChatGPT API for personalized herbalist recommendations\n• Figma with AI-enhanced prototyping for rapid iteration\n• Advanced user journey mapping with behavioral insights\n• A/B testing on critical conversion points\n• Mobile-first responsive design with accessibility focus\n\nThe solution wasn't just better design—it was strategically positioning trust and education at every touchpoint to transform skeptical visitors into confident consultation bookers.",
