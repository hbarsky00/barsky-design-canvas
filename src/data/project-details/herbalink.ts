  challenge: "Traditional herbal medicine practitioners and patients lacked a modern platform to connect and manage treatments effectively. Patients struggled to find qualified herbalists, while practitioners needed tools to manage patient relationships and build their practice online.",

  // Additional challenge text that will appear between images
  challengeAdditionalText: "Many people face challenges such as unreliable information and inconsistent or unsafe online advice, which can lead to confusion and potential harm. Additionally, locating trusted practitioners, including herbalists, remains difficult, making it hard to find reputable experts when needed. There is also a notable lack of effective tools for tracking progress, leaving individuals unable to monitor their health effectively. Furthermore, poor interface design and complex platforms often overwhelm people, hindering their ability to navigate and utilize resources efficiently.",

  process: "I designed a personalized dashboard that tracks upcoming consultations and ongoing herb protocols, paired with a smart herbalist discovery system featuring specialty filtering and instant booking capabilities. The core experience centers around an integrated consultation interface with video calls, real-time note collaboration, and herb identification tools. I also created a visual recommendation system using herb cards with progress tracking and local supplier integration to support users' wellness journeys.",

  result: "The design achieved an 85% task completion rate for bookings and 4.2/5 usability score, with 78% of users feeling more confident about herbal wellness. Key learnings included the critical importance of trust-building features in wellness apps, the need for seamless education-consultation integration, and that mobile-first design is essential for accessibility in this space.",
