  challenge: "Many individuals seeking natural health solutions face significant barriers in finding qualified herbalists with verifiable credentials. Traditional healthcare platforms lack specialized features for herbal medicine practitioners, while patients struggle to determine the legitimacy and expertise of providers. This disconnect leads to missed opportunities for effective natural treatments and a general distrust in herbal medicine.",
  process: "I conducted extensive research with both herbalists and potential patients to understand their unique needs and communication barriers. Through collaborative design workshops, I developed user personas representing different stakeholder groups and mapped out comprehensive user journeys for various interaction scenarios. Multiple rounds of wireframing and prototyping focused on creating an intuitive interface that addresses privacy concerns while facilitating effective communication between practitioners and clients.",
  result: "The Herbalink mobile application successfully bridges the gap between qualified herbalists and individuals seeking natural health solutions. The platform features secure video consultations, credential verification for practitioners, a comprehensive treatment tracking system, and an in-app messaging feature for follow-up questions. Initial user data shows a 65% increase in first-time herbal consultations and significantly improved treatment adherence through the app's monitoring tools.",
