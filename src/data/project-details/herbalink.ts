  challenge: "Primary Challenge: Building Trust in a Skeptical Market - The biggest challenge was creating a platform that would instill confidence in users who are often skeptical about online health services, especially in the alternative medicine space. Users needed assurance about herbalist qualifications while herbalists needed tools to establish credibility and manage their practice effectively.\n\nComplex Information Architecture: Creating an intuitive flow that balances comprehensive health intake with user-friendly simplicity. Initial testing showed users were overwhelmed by too many questions upfront. I solved this by implementing progressive disclosure and adaptive questioning that adjusts based on user responses.\n\nRegulatory & Safety Considerations: Ensuring the platform met health information privacy requirements while providing clear disclaimers about herbal consultations not replacing medical care. I worked closely with legal advisors to implement appropriate safeguards and user education about the scope of herbal consultations.",

  process: "User Interview Sessions: I conducted interviews with 12 participants (6 potential users, 6 practicing herbalists) to understand pain points and opportunities in the herbal wellness space. Key findings revealed users struggled with finding qualified herbalists and felt uncertain about practitioner backgrounds. High costs and limited rural availability created barriers to accessing herbal care.\n\nHerbalist Discovery User Flows: I mapped out core user journeys focusing on trust-building and education. The architecture prioritized herbalist discovery as the primary entry point, with consultation booking and educational content easily accessible. This approach ensured users could find qualified practitioners while learning about herbal wellness throughout their journey.\n\nDesign System & Components: Built a trust-focused design language with natural colors and accessible interaction patterns. Prioritized mobile-first design with thumb-friendly navigation and clear visual hierarchy for herbalist credentials and specializations.\n\nTrust-Building Features: I designed comprehensive herbalist profiles featuring detailed certification displays, educational backgrounds, verified testimonials, and specialization areas to build user confidence. The solution included a smart matching algorithm considering health goals, consultation preferences, and herbalist specializations for optimal pairing.",

  result: "Through prototype testing with potential users, I validated core design assumptions and identified key areas for improvement. Users appreciated the trust-building features and found the herbalist matching process intuitive. The testing revealed that transparency in wellness apps is critical, and users valued the educational integration that helped them feel more confident about herbal consultations.\n\nThe app has been developed and is ready for market launch, with the design foundation in place to support both users seeking herbal guidance and practitioners looking to grow their practice digitally. Key learnings included the importance of understanding both sides of a marketplace and creating educational experiences that empower informed wellness decisions.\n\nKey Design Impact: Herbalink addresses a significant gap in the wellness market by creating a trusted, educational platform for herbal consultations. The design prioritizes transparency, accessibility, and user empowerment while respecting the expertise of certified herbalists.",
