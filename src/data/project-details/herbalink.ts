  challenge: "Traditional herbal medicine practitioners and patients lacked a modern platform to connect and manage treatments effectively. Patients struggled to find qualified herbalists, while practitioners needed tools to manage patient relationships and build their practice online.",

  process: "Key Design Features\n\nI designed a personalized dashboard that tracks upcoming consultations and ongoing herb protocols, paired with a smart herbalist discovery system featuring specialty filtering and instant booking capabilities. The core experience centers around an integrated consultation interface with video calls, real-time note collaboration, and herb identification tools. I also created a visual recommendation system using herb cards with progress tracking and local supplier integration to support users' wellness journeys.",

  result: "The design achieved an 85% task completion rate for bookings and 4.2/5 usability score, with 78% of users feeling more confident about herbal wellness. Key learnings included the critical importance of trust-building features in wellness apps, the need for seamless education-consultation integration, and that mobile-first design is essential for accessibility in this space.",
