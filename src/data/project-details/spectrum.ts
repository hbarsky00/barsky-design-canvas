  challenge: "Spectrum Apparel needed a modern e-commerce platform that could showcase their custom apparel design capabilities while providing an intuitive shopping experience. The challenge was creating a system that could handle both pre-designed products and custom design requests, integrate with their manufacturing workflow, and provide customers with real-time design previews. The platform needed to be accessible to users with varying design experience while maintaining professional quality output.",

  process: "I conducted user research with both casual customers and professional designers to understand different use cases for custom apparel design. The design process involved creating user flows for both simple customization and complex design projects. I developed wireframes that separated basic customization from advanced design tools, ensuring each user type had an appropriate experience. The design system emphasized visual clarity and included comprehensive accessibility testing to ensure the platform worked for users with different abilities.",

  result: "The Spectrum Apparel platform launched successfully with both basic customization and advanced design tools, resulting in a 60% increase in custom orders and 40% improvement in customer satisfaction. The accessibility-focused design ensured the platform was usable by customers with visual impairments and other disabilities. The integrated blog and design showcase helped establish Spectrum as a thought leader in custom apparel, leading to partnerships with local sports teams and organizations.",
