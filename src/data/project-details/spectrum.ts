  challenge: "The autism awareness apparel market lacked a dedicated platform that combined customization options with accessibility features. Existing e-commerce solutions failed to address the specific needs of this community, such as sensory-friendly design interfaces and size-inclusive options. Additionally, there was a missed opportunity to integrate autism awareness content with the shopping experience.",
  process: "I led the design and development of an inclusive e-commerce platform specifically tailored for autism awareness apparel and custom shirt creation. The process involved extensive collaboration with autism advocacy groups and individuals on the spectrum to ensure the platform met their unique needs. I created wireframes and prototypes focusing on accessibility, simplicity, and visual clarity. User testing sessions with diverse participants, including those with various accessibility requirements, helped refine the final design.",
  result: "Spectrum Apparel Co. emerged as a modern, accessible e-commerce platform dedicated to autism awareness apparel and custom shirt creation. The platform features an intuitive drag-and-drop shirt designer with real-time preview of customizations, automated inventory management, and a size recommendation tool. The shopping experience is streamlined for all users, with particular attention to accessibility needs. The integrated blog section for autism awareness content and community stories has fostered a sense of community around the brand, driving engagement and customer loyalty beyond typical e-commerce metrics.",
