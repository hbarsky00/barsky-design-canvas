*A comprehensive guide based on the successful approach of Hiram Barsky at Barsky Design*

## The Power of Strategic Portfolio Titles

Your portfolio titles are often the first impression potential clients and employers have of your work. They serve as both SEO magnets and instant value communicators. This guide breaks down the proven title formula that has helped Barsky Design achieve excellent search visibility and professional presentation.

## The Winning Formula

### Core Structure: `[Industry/Project Type] + [Core Problem/Solution] + [Brand Name]`

**Example from Barsky Design:**
- "Co-Parenting App UX Design | Splittime Case Study | Barsky Design"
- "Herbal Wellness App Design | Herbalink UX Research | Barsky Design"
- "Banking App UX Design | Investor Loan Platform | Barsky Design"

### Why This Formula Works

1. **Immediate Context** - Users know exactly what they're looking at
2. **Problem-Solution Clarity** - Shows your design thinking approach
3. **Professional Branding** - Consistent brand presence across all projects
4. **SEO Optimization** - Naturally includes relevant keywords
5. **Scannable Structure** - Easy for both humans and search engines to parse

## Character Count Guidelines

### The 50-60 Character Sweet Spot

- **Homepage**: 45-55 characters (most important page)
- **Project Pages**: 50-60 characters (allows for more detail)
- **Service Pages**: 45-55 characters (clear and concise)

**Barsky Design Examples:**
- ✅ "UX Designer | Mobile Apps & Web Design | Barsky Design" (54 chars)
- ✅ "Co-Parenting App UX Design | Splittime Case Study | Barsky Design" (65 chars)
